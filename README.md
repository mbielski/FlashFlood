# Flash Flood

A simple game of colors. There are countless versions of this on the various markets. I became 
hooked on it one day and decided that I needed to write one myself. This was somewhere near 8
years ago. Fast-forward to today. This repo exists because I found the game code and decided
that it needed an update but I also wanted to preserve my steps along the way.

# Playing Flash Flood

The general idea is to turn the whole board one color in 25 clicks or less. Start with the top
left corner and choose what color should replace what is there. Pick one of the colors that 
touches that color. Then pick another... and another... it's all about knowing what color to 
choose next...

 - Open the .htm file. The game should load with a random board layout.
 - If you don't like the board, click New Game to get another one generated for you.
 - Click the 6 color squares at top left to change the flood color.
 - When you are done the Stats section will update with your results.
